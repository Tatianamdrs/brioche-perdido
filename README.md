# ðŸ¥– Brioche Perdido â€“ Scratch Version

**Part of the Harvard CS50 course portfolio**  

Brioche Perdido is my **first experimental project** created in Scratch as part of my CS50 coursework.  
This is the **initial spark** of a bigger game currently being developed in Godot, where we explore **platform mechanics, narrative, and interactive fun**.

## About the Game

In The journey of the lost brioche, you control **Croissant3000** a spaceship navigating tricky levels, avoiding enemies, and battleling a boss.  
The project combines **fun storytelling**, **pixel art sprites**, and **basic shooter game mechanics**, serving as the first prototype for the upcoming Godot version.

## Notes & Reflections

- This project was an **introductory experiment** in game development.
- This project was required as part of Harvard CS50 Week 0 Problem Set.  
- Helps visualize **game mechanics** and **level design** before building the full Godot version.  
- Comments, feedback, and contributions are welcome â€“ every small tweak is XP gained!

> âš¡ Developer's note: Brioche Perdido may be small in Scratch, but itâ€™s the **first level of a bigger adventure**. Each sprite, enemy, and collectible is a step closer to the full Godot experience!
